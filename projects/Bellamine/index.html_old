<p>A project for ECE 547 "VLSI Design"<br>Spring Semester 2007 <br>Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering <br>University of Maine</p>
<p>designed by<br><c>Taoufiq Bellamine</c><br></p>

The Project consists of an 8 Bit Current Steering DAC operating from
three supplies of 5v, 2.5v and 3.5v. The process used for this purpose
is a 0.5 um CMOS process. The fact that the current steering topology
is used instead of the R2R topology made it more challenging to achieve
a good INL as well as DNL results. Glitching power from clock feedthrough and signal coupling was minimized
through the use of special latches and charge injection switches. The Op Amp used in this project was
designed to have a 90 dB open loop gain and a 20 MHz unity bandwidth.
The output range of the DAC was in the order of 1.96 v with an LSB of
8.2 mv.
