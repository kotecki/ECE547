<p>The design, schematic, layout, and simulation of a tunable Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) for
wireless interrogation of a one port Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonator based sensor is
described in this report. The SAW sensors have resonant frequencies ranging from 285MHz to
345MHz and a high quality factor. The narrowband LNA, which operates between 303MHz and
356MHz, is designed using a 0.18Î¼m CMOS technology in Cadence. Two port analysis of the
LNA shows that at 330MHz the LNA has a gain of 12.8dB and Noise Figure (NF) of 3.65dB
while drawing 6mA of current. The lowest gain for the design is 11.5dB at 303MHz and the
highest noise figure is 3.74dB at 356MHz.
