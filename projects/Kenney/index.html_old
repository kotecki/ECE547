<P>This is the 2nd tapeout of the telecoil project. The low-noise amplifier in first run, submitted in the Fall of 2004, described in the <A HREF="../MagSensor/ccarr.pdf">project report</A> suffered from an input offset error and was redesigned. The work constituted part of my <a href="http://www.eece.maine.edu/~kotecki/Students/CRK01thesis.pdf">M.S. thesis</a> in Electrical Engineering which was awarded in May of 2005. </p>

<p>This project consists of a integrated circuit that tests two amplifiers hooked up to an integrated telecoil, as well as several test amplifier circuits. The amplifiers are based on a single stage Cherry-Hooper configuration. The single stage Cherry Hooper design is simulated at a gain of 29 dB, THD of -50dB, and equivalent input noise of 2.01nV/sqrt(Hz). The three stage Cherry Hooper design with filter is simulated at a gain of 84 dB, THD of -49dB, and equivalent input noise of 2.01nV/sqrt(Hz). The three stage amplifier also has a bandwidth of 3kHz and a driving capacity of 30pF external load capacitance.</p>
