Pipeline A/D converters are tipically used in moderate resolution high speed applications. In pipeline
architecture, several stages with a low resolution per stage are cascaded to obtain a high overall A/D
converter resolution.
This VLSI design project consists of a 10-bit, 50MHz, pipeline architecture A/D converter. The converter is
implemented with a 9 stage pipeline architecture, 1.5-bit per stage. The design is based on a switch-capacitor
circuitry. Each stage consists of a gain stage (
<A HREF="../TelescopicOpAmp">OTA</A> 
(designed by Erik McCarthy) and S/H switch capacitors),
differential comparators (sub-ADC), and a sub-DAC. Intermediate bits (1.5 bits/stage) are not digitally corrected,
instead they are the outputs of the converter. The die size is 1.5 x 1.5 mm and it is packaged in a 40 pin DIP. 
The <A HREF="./adc1050.pdf">project report</A> contains a description of the project, details of 
the design and layout, and test results.
