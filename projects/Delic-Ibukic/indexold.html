<p> Pipeline A/D converters are tipically used in moderate resolution high
speed applications. In pipeline architecture, several stages with a low resolution
per stage are cascaded to obtain a high overall A/D converter resolution. 
This VLSI design project consists of a 10-bit, 50MHz, pipeline architecture
A/D converter. The converter is implemented with a 9 stage pipeline architecture,
1.5-bit per stage. The design is based on a switch-capacitor circuitry. Each
stage consists of a gain stage (OTA (designed by Erik McCarthy) and S/H switch
capacitors), differential comparators (sub-ADC), and a sub-DAC. Intermediate
bits (1.5 bits/stage) are not digitally corrected, instead they are the outputs
of the converter.  The <a href="http://www.eece.maine.edu/%7Eadelic-i/adc1050.pdf">project report</a> contains a description of the project, details of 
the design and layout, and test results.
