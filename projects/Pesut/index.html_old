<p>A project for ECE 547 "VLSI Design"<br> 
Fall Semester 2010 at the<br> 
Electrical Engineering Dept. of the <br> 
University of Maine</p>

<p>The design consists of three main stages. First, there is a circuit that is sensitive to ambient temperature changes. An amplification stage then turns the output of the sensing circuit into a usable signal. Lastly, the amplified signal is fed into a
10-bit analog-to-digital converter. The ADC is a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) which utilizes an R-2R Digital-to-Analog converter to generate the digital outputs. Simulations show the sensor to have a resolution of approximately +.5 oC with each conversion taking approximately a minimum of 550 Î¼s and a maximum of 1.05 ms. Test and verification procedures are outlined and described.  Both a low and high current design are implemented on the chip.</p>
