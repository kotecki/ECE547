This project presents the design and simulation of a switched oscillator intended 
to be the first part of the front end of a Light Detection and Ranging (LADAR) system.
A chirped frequency modulated (FM) LADAR system works by driving a laser beam
modulated by a chirped FM signal. The chirp is a sinusoidal waveform that begins at
a start frequency (fstart) and ramps up to an end frequency (fstop), forming sawtooth
pattern with respect to the frequency of the sinusoid. By comparing the transmitted
signal with the reflected signal, a distance to target may be determined. The goal of this
particular integrated circuit (IC) is to form the FM chirp signal necessary to a LADAR
system as a whole.
