<p>The design, simulation and layout of a low power‘UMAINE ECE’ Morse code Read Only Memory and transmitter are described. The chip uses a band-gap reference circuit to convert a voltage stored onto 
a capacitor, to a DC power supply that is insensitive to temperature.  The band-gap reference powers a variety of clocks used in the timing for 32x4-bit ROM and 32-bit multiplexer; all based from a 
voltage-controlled oscillator.  The output of the ROM and multiplexer is the Morse code representation of UMAINE ECE, which is transmitted by a 433MHz sinusoidal oscillator and off-chip antennae.  
Logic 1 is represented by oscillation and Logic 0 is no oscillation.  Simulations show less than +10mV variation around 1.185V in the band-gap reference output from -50?C to 125?C with a charge 
on the capacitor ranging from 1.7V to 2.6V.  The output of the overall circuit is a 325mV peak-to-peak sinusoid that oscillates at 433MHz (ISM-band frequency), where each character in the Morse 
code has a 50ms pulse width.  Test and verification procedures are outlined and described.</p>
