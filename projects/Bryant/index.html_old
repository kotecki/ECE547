This chip contains two fourth-order MASH architecture switched capacitor sigma-delta ADCs, one channel each for the in-phase and quadrature parts of the
signal.  The input signal is translated in frequency by a switched capacitor network, which alternates the sampling capacitor used by the first loop of the converter.  This
allows the user to choose the frequency band of the input signal that will be converted with the best resolution by the loop.  The
digital filters recombine the bits from each stage in the MASH architecture which helps to remove error generated in the first stage.  The
converter runs at a maximum sampling frequency of 5MHz, and the input signal is converted in sections of Fs/32.  The recombined outputs from two chips run in parallel
will be used to convert a larger portion of the input spectrum.
