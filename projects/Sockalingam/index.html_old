<p> This ECE547 VLSI Design project consists of a 10-bit, 5MHz, pipeline architecture, analog to digital converter. 
The converter is implemented with a 9 stage pipeline architecture.  The design is based on switch-capacitor circuitry. Each
stage consists of an OTA, differential comparators(sub-ADC) and a sub-DAC. The converter accepts 0-1V (2.5V offset) fully
differential signal up to 2.5MHz.  The 1.5 bits/stage output is digitally corrected to obtain a 10 bit ADC output.
MOSIS implements the device in AMI's C5N process technology. The 0.5 micron minimum gate length is physically designed on a 0.15 micron grid.
This constrains the gate length to a minimum of 0.6 microns. The die size is 1.5 X 1.5 microns and will be packaged in a 40 pin DIP.
