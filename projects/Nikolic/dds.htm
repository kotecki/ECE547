        </strong><br>
My Direct Digital Synthesizer IC design has been created and submitted
for fabrication on a 1.5mm x 1.5mm silicon chip. This project meets
requirements of ECE547 VLSI Design / Layout class where I have
performed my own CMOS transistor level design, simulation, partial
custom chip layout, complete verification, and parasitic extraction. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>What is Direct Digital Synthesizer? </strong><br>
          <br>
Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) produces an analog waveform &#8211; usually
a sine wave &#8211; by generating a time-varying signal in digital form and
then performing a digital-to-analog conversion. Because operations
within a DDS are primarily digital, it can offer fast switching between
output frequencies, fine frequency resolution and operation over a
broad spectrum of frequencies.</p>
      The full project report will be posted here before May 13.<br>
