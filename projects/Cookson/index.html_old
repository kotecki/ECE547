There is always a push to create amplifiers that are more efficient. High efficiency translates to less power wasted, lower operating tempretures,
and longer battery life in portable applications. For audio amplifiers, it is also imperative to have excellent sound quality by maintaining low 
distortion through the entire audio range.<BR>
<P>
This ECE 547 VLSI projects implements a Class D amplifier. The amplifier achieves high efficiency by using a pulse width modulation (PWM) scheme 
to convert the analog input into a stream of "pulses". These pulses in turn control the transistors on an on-chip H-BRidge thus allowing current to flow through 
the load. 
The inputs to the circuit are stereo line-in audio, and the outputs are designed to drive an eight ohm speaker. Volume control has also been implemented 
as a five-bit digital number input.
