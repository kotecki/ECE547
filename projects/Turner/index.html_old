Class-D amplifiers are becoming key components of low power modern consumer devices.  Their high
efficiency makes them ideal audio amplifiers in laptops, cell-phones, subwoofers, and other mobile
audio devices.  This VLSI project implements the signal processing "front end" component of a
class-D amplifier.  The inputs to the circuit are stereo line-in audio, and the outputs are designed
to drive an H-bridge for each audio channel.  Volume control has also been implemented as a five-bit
digital number input.
