This design is an 8-bit, 50MHz, unit-element, current-steering DAC operating from a 5V supply. The topology is used
to achieve high speed, monotonicity and good matching, while it has drawbacks of complex structure, large area
and high power dissipation. Its major componentss are registers, binary-to-thermometer decoders, a current cell array
which includes 16x16 unit current cells and an op-amp with a buffer.
