</h1><p></p>

<p>A project for ECE 547 "VLSI Design"<br>
Fall Semester 2004 at the<br>
Electrical Engineering Dept. of the <br>
University of Maine</p>

<p> DPLLs (Digital Phase Locked Loop) are commonly used in communications systems.  
As part of an investigation into RFID technology, a DPLL suitable for low-cost, low-power 
applications is designed and layed out out in a 0.5um CMOS process.  It consists of a 
phase frequency detector, charge-pump filter, current-starved VCO, and a frequency divider.  
It is designed to operate using a reference signal between 10MHz and 46MHz producing an output 
signal between 80MHz and 368MHz (nominal inout of 40MHz yeilds an output frequency of 320MHz).  
The DPLL is part of a three chip RFID transceiver systems and generates additional signals 
(10MHz, 0.625MHz and lock enable) for use in the system.</p>
